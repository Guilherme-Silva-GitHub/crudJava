1 - First of all, we have to create a database with a name of our choice. In this case, it is "cadastro_crud".

2 - We create a table, like "usuarios".

3 - We insert the columns that this table will contain. In this project:
    => id int AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
    => nome varchar(200)
    => idade int
    => email varchar(200)
    => senha varchar(200)
    => dt_cadastro date

4 - We choose an IDE that will be used for this CRUD. NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.

5 - It's very important to have the .jar of the JDBC. In this case, it will be catch in the site of the mysql:
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/


6 - Let's coding ":)"!

--- Observation: This repository will contain only the codes, not the libraries for example.

On the top of the code, will be the "imports".
